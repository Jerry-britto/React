This is a very challenging project for me uptil now because I have learned many things which I never learned it before.
The project is basically a password generator which was initially been viewed as a very simple project for me but then I understood that to make even a simple project you need to think a lot and apply a logic.
I mainly learned 3 types of hooks which helped to achieve to make this project which are useEffect,useCallback and useRef
